# [DEMOQA.COM](https://demoqa.com) TESTS

[demoqa.com](https://demoqa.com) is a basic demo site provided by [toolsqa.com](https://www.toolsqa.com) to learn and practice Selenium. It contains training modules like contact forms, menus to select, buttons to click etc.

In these automated tests I have used a combination of Selenium WebDriver with Java Script. I have learned many methods like: `get()`, `getTitle()`, `getCurrentUrl()`, `getAttribute()`, `getText()`, `findElement()`, `click()`, `sendKeys()`, `switchTo()`; or methods from Actions class: `keyDown()`, `keyUp()`, `dragAndDrop()`, `doubleClick()`, `contextClick()` and `move()`.

Below record presents my test script execution:
